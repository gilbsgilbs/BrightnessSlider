## BrightnessSlider

An android app to bring back the ability to modulate brightness by sliding over
the status bar.

### TODO

- An UI
- A logo
- Ability to disable double-tap to lock
- Maybe bring some other features to the status bar
- Test other android versions

### Known issues

- The slider will still work in fullscreen mode (when the status bar is
  hidden), which is probably undersirable, especially in games. As a
  workaround, it is possible to use the quick settings tile when in fullscreen
  to disable the bar temporarily.
